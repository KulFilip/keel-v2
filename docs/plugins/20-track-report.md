# 20 · The plugin track: the final proof

**Branch:** `feat/plugin-step4` (the plugin track). Local only, not pushed, never merged into `main`, never tagged.

**What the track is:** keel **0.16.1** (main merged into the track, see
[12-step3-progress.md](12-step3-progress.md#port-of-01570161-main-merged-into-the-track)) **+ plugin steps 1–7**:

- every part is a plugin: `plugins/{map,wiki,ci,tasks,jira,db,review,git,graph,code,keelbot}` and `product/`;
- the marketplace (find, install, update, roll back, remove, agents ask);
- each plugin can live in its own repo, with `plugins.lock`;
- the core image (`:core`);
- other publishers (`keel-plugin dev`, the template repo, the guide).

**The rule:** the plugin build must work **the same** as the current release. The plugin work may only **add**. Each
addition is in `e2e/parity/allow.yml`, with its reason.

> Parity is checked against **0.16.1, the current release**. (The rule said 0.15.1 when that was the current release.)

One small keel bug was found and fixed, and three bugs in the new plugins-each test (below). One flake of keel 0.16.1's own code went on the allow list, with proof.

## What was fixed

| what | why | fix |
| ---- | --- | --- |
| an agent could not ask for a plugin | `keel_plugin_request` is a **read**-level MCP tool (agents run `keel2 mcp --read-only`). 0.16.1's level guard came with the merge and treats every POST as a write, so `POST /api/plugins/requests` answered 403. The marketplace e2e found it ("an agent asks"). | `McpLevelGuard` lets this one route pass at the read level. It only opens an Inbox request; a person approves it, and the rule "agents may ask" still decides. New test: `McpLevelsApiTest` "an agent at the read level may ask for a plugin, never install one". |
| plugins-each failed on 0.16.1's own requests | The test project has no GitHub remote, so CI/CD's runs and Git's pull request answer 400. 0.16.1 does the same (parity lists them as notes). | `e2e/plugins-each/walk.mjs` does not count these two known 400s (and their console line). Every other failed request still fails the run. |
| plugins-each: Product's pages looked "missing" | `#/initiatives` and `#/teams` are add-on screens (`/api/features` → `screens`), opened by the add-on loader as in 0.16.1, not pages in the registry. The walk only knew the registry. | The walk counts the add-on screens as pages (and as Product's own pages). A test fix, not a keel fix. |
| plugins-each: a flow link opened the wrong project | The product image has a second project (`keel-product`, Product's own). The walk chose the first project, the flow was in `shop`, so `GET /api/projects/keel-product/flows/<id>` → 404. | The walk opens the e2e's project (`KEEL_WALK_PROJECT`); the e2e picks `shop` by id. A test fix. New options `--name` and `--port` let several runs go side by side. |

- **mcp**: `keel2 mcp` at read, `--write` and `--admin`: 0.16.1's tools in 0.16.1's order, then the four marketplace
  tools at the end (allowed). `keel_actions` is the same.
- **layout**: both projects (`shop` with keel files in `docs/`, `notes` with the new default `.keel/`): the same layout,
  the same files on disk, the same `.git/info/exclude`.
- **flow**: a `change` flow on the fake model on each project stops at the same gates.
- **new in B**: the 12 new endpoints of steps 1–4 (plugin host, approvals, kinds, sections, plugin settings, the
  marketplace). **allowed**: `/api/features` lists the plugins' web parts; the Control › Plugins menu entry and page;
  the model probe (next part).
- **skipped**: endpoints that need a value neither keel has (a spec page; a file's history before a flow wrote one).

### The flake, and the proof

Parity ran **4 times** on the track's images:

| run | image | result |
| --- | ----- | ------ |
| 1 | first `fin` | PASSED |
| 2 | `fin` again (with the api fix) | 4 differences: codex's model list (8 on A, 3 on B) and Copilot's label on the Connections page |
| 3 | the same, run again (a flake?) | 3 differences: Copilot's label, **the other way round** (A had the CLI's, B the built-in one) |
| 4 | the same, with the two allow entries | PASSED |

Why: keel asks the CLIs for their models (`codex debug models`, `copilot --help`) and waits **4 seconds**. On a busy
computer a cold CLI is slower. Then keel shows its **built-in** list for 10 minutes. This is 0.16.1's own code
(`models/catalog.py` is the same on the track), and it happens on A and on B. The proof:

| | 0.16.1 | `keel-v2:fin` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| claude | 2.1.197 | 2.1.197 |
| codex | 0.162.1 | 0.162.1 |
| copilot | 1.0.98 | 1.0.98 |
| opencode | 1.19.0 | 1.19.0 |
| codegraph | 1.6.2 | 1.6.2 |
| `codex debug models` | 8 models | 8 models |

So the two new allow entries (`allow.yml`) name only these lines: codex's `efforts` count and the Copilot model
button's label. The other allow entry for `/api/providers/models` (a newer CLI may list more models) matched nothing
this time: the CLIs are the same.

## Each plugin alone, off and with all

`python3 e2e/plugins-each/e2e.py --image keel-v2:fin --product-image keel-v2:fin-product` on the throw-away keel
`keel-each` (127.0.0.1:8091). For each plugin it turns plugins on and off with `keel-engine plugins set`, restarts keel
in the same container, then checks: `/api/plugin-host` (exactly the expected plugins, no problem), every plugin's api
(answers when on, 404 when off), the MCP tools of db, git and ci (there only when on; keel's own tools always the
same), the project, a `change` flow to its first gate, and the web in headless Chromium (every menu page with its tabs:
no console error, no failed request, no request to an off plugin, no link to a missing page; a plugin's pages there
only when it is on).

- **alone** = only this plugin on (and what it needs: ci → git, jira → tasks, review → keelbot, product → tasks + jira)
- **off** = this plugin off (and what needs it); all others on

Full image `keel-v2:fin` (run of 2026-10-15, 54.8 min for both phases; the walk already had fix 2 below):

A plugin's own pages (the page registry): code → `repo`, keelbot → `helper`, map → `map`, graph → `graph`, wiki → `wiki`,
tasks → `tasks`. Git, db, review, ci and jira have no page of their own: they add slots and views to other pages.

CORE_NATIVE_ROWS

## What is left only for Milad

These steps go outside this computer (keys, GitHub, releases). Nothing here did them.

1. **Keys and secrets:** `docs/plugins/tools/setup-signing-keys.sh --org` (try `--dry-run` first). It stores the
   catalog key and the publisher key as GitHub secrets (the publisher key also as keel-studio's organisation secret
   `KEEL_PUBLISHER_KEY`) and writes only the public keys. Commit `content/trust/*.pub` and `publishers/keel.yml`.
2. **The token** `KEEL_STUDIO_TOKEN` (Contents: read and write on the `keel-plugin-*` repos), with `gh secret set`.
3. **The marketplace repo** `keel-studio/keel-marketplace`: fill it with [marketplace-repo/](marketplace-repo/), and
   turn on **GitHub Pages** (Source: GitHub Actions). The repos must be public.
4. **The plugin repos and the template:** `docs/plugins/tools/split-plugin.sh <name> <dir> --push` per plugin (it only
   prints the push commands), and `split-plugin.sh --template … --push`, then mark the template repo as a template.
5. **First releases:** tag `v1.0.0` in each plugin repo (its `release.yml` signs and uploads the `.kplug`), then run
   the marketplace's `sync.yml` once.
6. **Switch to `plugins.lock`:** `scripts/update-plugins-lock.sh <name>…`, commit the lock; when every plugin has a
   release, build with `PLUGINS=lock` (a build argument in `docker.yml`), and later remove `plugins/` from keel-v2.
7. **Publish `:core`:** `docker.yml`'s `core` job pushes `:<version>-core` (and `:core`) on a release tag. The first
   tag with the track makes it.

## Open decisions

1. **The defaults** in [README.md](README.md#open-questions-for-milad), questions 1–5 and 7–10 (knowledge in core,
   Code's split, the parts not in your list, `:latest` vs `:core` at 1.0, signing, other publishers, restart, the
   CodeGraph CLI, plugins' Python libraries). The track uses the defaults of
   [15-step4-report.md](15-step4-report.md#the-defaults-contract-0-milad-can-change-them).
2. **`keel2 start --native --core` is refused** ("--core is for the Docker image"). Native mode always has every plugin;
   `--safe` or `KEEL_PLUGINS=off` gives fewer. Is that right, or should native mode get a core-only release too?
3. **MCP tools whose route is a plugin's:** without the Code, Wiki or Graph plugin, `keel_read_file`, `keel_specs`
   with a path, `keel_knowledge` with a section and `keel_search` for symbols answer the api's **404**. They are still
   listed (0.16.1's list must stay the same with every plugin on). Keep it so, or hide them / give a clearer message
   when the plugin is off?
4. From [15-step4-report.md](15-step4-report.md#open): a plugin's agents are not on the Agents page; a content-only
   plugin does not load its workflows and agents yet.

## Disk

The run built one image at a time and removed each one after its tests. Free space on the data disk: DISK_LINE.
