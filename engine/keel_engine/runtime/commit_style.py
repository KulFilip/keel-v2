"""How keel's commits read (keel 0.18.57), and the lines keel adds to them that its own checks read back.

keel's own subject is `<type>(<scope>): <subject>` (test(AC-2): ..., feat(AC-2): ...): the trace links a criterion to
its commits by it, and the audit sorts test commits from implementation commits by it. A project may want its own
style, for example `SHOPS-1234: feat: show prices in euros`. Two ways:

    git.commit_template in .keel/config.yml   placeholders {ticket} {type} {scope} {subject}, e.g. "{ticket}: {type}: {subject}"
    inferred                                  from the branch's last non-merge commits that keel did not make: a ticket
                                              prefix ("SHOPS-12: ", "[SHOPS-12] ") and a conventional type ("feat: ",
                                              "feat(x): "), when most of them share it

When the subject keel writes is not its own form, the commit carries the trailer `Keel-Ref: test(AC-2)`, so the trace,
the audit and the bug flow still read the commit as keel's (ref_of).

Two more trailers say why a commit looks the way it does, so the ship audit does not refuse what keel itself did:

    Keel-Path: already-met       the "Mark as already met" answer committed the criterion's test (test(AC-n))
    Keel-Unlocked: a.php, b.php  test files the phase normally refuses, opened for it by an unlock (keel's own after a
                                 criterion's test broke tests outside it, or a person's); the unlock has its reason

    trailers(body) / ref_of(subject, body)          read them back
    template(root, cfg)                              the style to write: the configured one, the inferred one, or None
    render(tpl, type, scope, subject, ticket)        one subject line in that style
    conventional_type(ctype, buckets, files, ...)    {type}: test, refactor, fix, docs or feat from what changed
    ticket_from_branch(branch)                       SHOPS-1234 from feature/SHOPS-1234-euro-prices
