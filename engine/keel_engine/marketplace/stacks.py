"""Stacks in the marketplace (keel 0.18.9, the fifth kind): find one, read what the catalog says about it, and fetch its
signed stack YAML for the api, which saves it in one project as `.keel/stacks/<name>.yml` (`POST /api/projects/{pid}/
stacks/market/install`). The engine stores nothing here: a stack is a file in the project, not a package in the plugin
store, and it needs no restart (keel reads a project's stacks when it needs them).

    search(q, category)       {stacks: [Hit], sources, categories}
    detail(name)              Hit + {versions, checks}
    fetch(name, version?)     the verified YAML and what the catalog says about it

A stack is one YAML file in the format of keel's own (content/stacks/*.yml): name, lane, detect, layers, commands, tools,
skills. It is shipped unchanged: fetch checks its sha256 and its publisher's signature, its name is the catalog's (and
its `version`, when it says one), keel's check of a stack finds no error in it (runtime/stack_edit.check), and keel's
review of it (kinds.stack_review: its lane, what detects it, its layers, every command and tool it runs, its skills) is
the catalog's.

Choosing a version: the newest that is not revoked (revoked by kind `stacks`) and whose `requires.keel` fits this keel.
A stack's commands run in the project's own toolchain through keel's flow and its shell guard, as a workflow's do, so
its trust is `content`: the rule "allow unverified publishers" does not block it. The review lists every command, so
the person reads them before the install.
