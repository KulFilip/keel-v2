"""Rule packs in the marketplace (docs/plugins/23-rules-in-marketplace.md): find one, read what the catalog says about
it, and fetch its signed YAML for the api, which installs it into a project through the rules api
(`POST /api/projects/{pid}/rule-packs/install {source: "marketplace", yaml, name, version}`). The engine stores nothing
here: a pack is a file in the project's `.keel/rules/`, not a package in the plugin store, and it needs no restart.

    search(q, category)       {rules: [Hit], sources, categories}
    detail(name)              Hit + {versions, checks}
    fetch(name, version?)     the verified YAML text and what the catalog says about it

A pack is the final format of keel 0.17.2 (docs/rules/pack-format.md, schema 1), shipped unchanged: fetch checks it with
keel's own parser (keel_engine.rules.packs.parse_pack), its name and version are the catalog's, its publisher is the
entry's, and keel's review of it (kinds.pack_review) is the catalog's.

Choosing a version: the newest that is not revoked (revoked by kind `rules`) and whose `requires.keel` fits this keel.
Refused (Hit.refused): an old (expired) catalog, or no version for this keel. A pack only refuses (it can never allow
what keel's own rules forbid), so its trust is `content`: the rule "allow unverified publishers" does not block it.
