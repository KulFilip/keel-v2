"""Skills in the marketplace (keel 0.18.6, the fourth kind): find one, read what the catalog says about it, and fetch its
signed SKILL.md for the api, which saves it as one of the project's skills (`POST /api/projects/{pid}/skills/market/
install`) and attaches it to the agents the person picks. The engine stores nothing here: a skill is a row of the
api's skills, not a package in the plugin store, and it needs no restart.

    search(q, category)       {skills: [Hit], sources, categories}
    detail(name)              Hit + {versions, checks}
    fetch(name, version?)     the verified SKILL.md text and what the catalog says about it

A skill is one SKILL.md (front matter `name` and `description`, then the text an agent reads), shipped unchanged: fetch
checks its sha256 and its publisher's signature, its front matter's name is the catalog's (and its `version`, when it
says one), and keel's review of it (kinds.skill_review: its size, its sections, its description) is the catalog's.

Choosing a version: the newest that is not revoked (revoked by kind `skills`) and whose `requires.keel` fits this keel.
A skill only adds words to an agent's prompt (keel's rules and the phase still decide what the agent may do), so its
trust is `content`: the rule "allow unverified publishers" does not block it.
