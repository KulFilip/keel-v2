"""Workflows in the marketplace (docs/plugins/21-workflow-marketplace.md): find one, read it, and fetch its signed YAML
for the api, which installs it into a project (WorkflowService). The engine stores nothing here: a workflow is data in
the api's database, not a package in the plugin store, and it needs no restart.

    search(q, category)       {workflows: [Hit], sources, categories}
    detail(name)              Hit + {versions, checks, refused}
    fetch(name, version?)     the verified YAML text and what the catalog says about it

Choosing a version: the newest that is not revoked, fits keel's version (requires.keel) and whose needed plugins this
keel runs (requires.plugins); when every such version needs a plugin keel does not run, the newest one that fits keel
is still chosen (so a person sees it and what it needs), with `fits: false` and `missing_plugins`. Refused: a revoked
version, an old (expired) catalog, a version for another keel. A workflow's trust is always `content` (it runs only
through keel's flow engine, its agents and its gates), so the rule "allow unverified publishers" does not block it,
as it does not block a content plugin. Fetch: the download (at most the catalog's size, at most 256 KB), its sha256
and its .minisig with one of its publisher's keys, then the text must be UTF-8 and a YAML mapping with a name.
